# Horiseon.Ch1
Challenge 1

For this Challenge I tested the accessibillity standars, opening the index.html provided in a default brouser. Realizing it needed some changes on HTML to properly work.

-First update was to provide a title to the Head. Changing "Webpage" to the name of the company "HORISEON".

-Second update was to provide a unique identifier (ID) to identify and make the link of the "Search Engine Optimization", from the top right on the page, work properly. To navigate directly to the paragraph (P) area with more information.

-Third update was to provide a unique identifier (ID) to each benefit. "Lead Generation", "Brand Awarness", and "Cost Managment". to be able to select and have a direct access, via class selector, and style it over CSS.

After Updating the code on HTML, I decided to inspect the Style.css file. 

I realized it had repetitive different identifiers with same code styles. Making the code look overwhelming big and not clean. Which it is possible to minimized by organizing it by a general identifier, or class, to select the areas needed to style. 

First it was the division (div) area, under the class "content". Line #30 on HTML. and #79 on CSS. Re-identifing from 3 different areas, to 1 general one under the same class.

Second it was the image (img) area, under the class "content". Line #30 on HTML. and #89 on CSS. Re-identifing from 3 different areas, to a general one under the same class.

Third it was the h2 area, under the class "conten". Starting on line #30 on HTML. and #94 on on CSS. Re-identifing from 3 different areas, to a general one under the same class.

Fourth it was the paragraph (p), under the class "benefits". Starting on line #55 on HTML. and #111 on on CSS. Re-identifing from 3 different areas, to a general one under the same class.

Fifth it was the h3, under the class "benefits". Starting on line #55 on HTML. and #118 on on CSS. Re-identifing from 3 different areas, to a general one under the same class. And adding a white color style to that specific identifier.

Sixth it was the image (img) area, under the class "benefits". Starting on line #55 on HTML. and #125 on on CSS. Re-identifing from 3 different areas, to a general one under the same class.

In conclusion, it had a minimal update on the Index.html code. with a deep and simple organization on the Style.css sheet. To make it functional and organized.
